## CustomUI panel
![custom_panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478779/28746049-c015846a-74bf-11e7-939b-c48fc9d606b1.png)

Use it to set device name.

In HA 0.52 or below needs to be registered manually or via customizer.<br>
In HA 0.53+ is added automatically to config panel.

## Features available for all domains

### Context-aware attributes
![context_aware](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/26284053/45fbc000-3e3b-11e7-8d4a-56ef0d5e6c60.png)

You can use context-aware attributes to give different names for the same entity in different groups, views, or devices.
See [context-aware.md](docs/context-aware.md)

### Badges in state cards
![badges](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/26284132/b4a2dbe6-3e3c-11e7-9bb5-0441d30342bf.png)

If you like badges, you can now put them in the state cards. This also works for domains that are usually not used as a badge. Lights for example.
There are 4 ways to put badges in a state card.

1) Turn a single state card into a badge. Adjacent badges will clamp together to a single line.

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "*.*":
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui  
    sensor.door_sensor:
      state_card_mode: badges
    sensor.yard_sensor:
      state_card_mode: badges

group:
  my_group:
    entities:
      - sensor.door_sensor
      - sensor.yard_sensor
```

2) Create a dedicated group of devices you want to display as badges and apply `state_card_mode: badges` to it. Note that this group must be in another group. The example below will show 2 sensors as badges in outer_group's card.

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "*.*":
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui  
    group.inner_group:
      state_card_mode: badges

group:
  inner_group:
    entities:
      - sensor.door_sensor
      - sensor.yard_sensor
  outer_group:
    entities:
      - group.inner_group
      *all other devices of outer_group*
```

3) If you already have a group, *part* of which you want to display as badges *inside another group* - use `badges_list` to filter badge wannabe entities. In the previous example, if you wanted to show only `sensor.door_sensor` as a badge in outer_group:
```yaml
...
    group.inner_group:
      state_card_mode: badges
      badges_list:
        - sensor.door_sensor
group:
  inner_group:
     ...
  outer_group:
    ...
...
```

4) Creating a dedicated group has a downside that the group will also show in the UI as whole in the default_view. To prevent that, you can make the group include itself. In the following example `inner_group` and `outer_group` are the same group:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "*.*":
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui  
    group.my_group:
      state_card_mode: badges

group:
  my_group:
    entities:
      - sensor.door_sensor
      - sensor.yard_sensor
      - group.my_group
      *all other devices of outer_group*
```
If you use this example as-is you will notice that all of your devices in the group appear both as regular state cards and as badges. To limit badges to the door/yard sensors only use `badges_list` from Example 2. To hide door/yard sensor cards (but leave them as badges) use the [Context-aware hide attribute](#context-aware-attributes) feature.  
Full example:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "*.*":
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui  
    group.my_group:
      state_card_mode: badges
      badges_list:
        - sensor.door_sensor
        - sensor.yard_sensor
    sensor.door_sensor:
      group:
        group.my_group:
          hidden: true
    sensor.yard_sensor:
      group:
        group.my_group:
          hidden: true

group:
  my_group:
    entities:
      - sensor.door_sensor
      - sensor.yard_sensor
      - light.mylight
      - group.my_group
```

### Per entity theming
Required HA 0.50+

![entity_themed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478779/28746280-0839b3f2-74c4-11e7-9478-bb197f9fd005.png)

You can select per-entity theme from the list of defined [themes](https://home-assistant.io/components/frontend/)
```yaml
frontend:
  themes:
    green_example:
      paper-toggle-button-checked-button-color: green
light.yard:
  theme: green_example
```

You can also use a conditional theme by using `theme_template` attribute. See [Templates](docs/templates.md)
```yaml
frontend:
  themes:
    green_example:
      paper-toggle-button-checked-button-color: green
light.yard:
  theme_template: ${entity.state}
```

### Secondary customUI
![secondary_custom_ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478779/30005196-a8d8bd2a-90e5-11e7-9f4c-a787a1227076.png)

If you would like to use your own [state-card-custom-alarm.html](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-ui-with-buttons-fan-control/13808/46) for `alarm_control_panel` but still enjoy framework features of CustomUI, like theming, you can use `state_card_custom_ui_secondary`:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "*.*":
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui
    alarm_control_panel.alarm:
      state_card_custom_ui_secondary: state-card-custom_alarm
```

## Features available for almost all domains.

The following is supported for all state cards except `configurator`

#### You can always show the last-changed text
![show_last_changed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/24838935/37b90bf8-1d5a-11e7-9e28-970740ba2fa8.png)

Use `show_last_changed: true`

Note that if you use the [extra_data_template](#you-can-add-extra-data-below-the-entity-name-requires-ha-043) below it will take precedence over `show_last_changed`

## Features available for light, cover, "plain", and "toggle" cards.

The next features are available for 4 types of cards:
* Light
* Cover,
* "Plain" i.e. card with icon, name, and state.
* "Toggle" i.e. card with icon, name, and toggle.

#### You can hide the control altogether
![hide_control](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/24772031/8a7d546e-1b18-11e7-935a-4360eeb9ebc8.png)

Use `hide_control: true` to hide the control (toggle / cover buttons) altogether.

#### You can add extra data below the entity name [Requires HA 0.43+]
![extra_data](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/24772032/8a7e90e0-1b18-11e7-9b3e-e36b56ef2417.png)

Use `extra_data_template` to add extra data below the entity name. The format is a [Templates](docs/templates.md).
For example to show power consumption from the `power_consumption` attribute use:
```yaml
extra_data_template: ${attributes.power_consumption}W
```

#### Add badge to the state card [Requires HA 0.42+]
![extra_badge](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/24772030/8a7cc4ea-1b18-11e7-9313-f7654ffb0c71.png)

Instead of using a grey text below the entity name you can add a sensor-like badge. There are two ways to do that:
1) Specify a real sensor by entity ID:
```yaml
extra_badge:
  entity_id: sensor.my_sensor
```
2) Make a fake sensor from entity's attribute:
```yaml
extra_badge:
  attribute: power_consumption
  unit: W
```

In both cases you can specify a blacklist of badge "states", when you don't want to see the badge.
```yaml
extra_badge:
  entity_id: sensor.my_sensor
  blacklist_states: 0
```

#### Confirmable controls
![confirmable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478779/28746903-6abd4be2-74ce-11e7-94d9-77423894c423.png)

Sometimes you don't want to flip a switch by mistake.

Use `confirm_controls_show_lock` to block the control and show a transparent lock icon over it. Tapping on the lock will open it for 5 seconds allowing to use the control. If you would like to prevent accidental flip without the visual lock hint, use `confirm_controls` instead.

## Features available for light and cover domains only

If there is enough space the card will have icon+name on the left, optional slider in the middle and toggle on the right:

![cover](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/23921980/4eab7978-0909-11e7-8058-ad17a52d93c3.png)

![wide](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/23335593/e344048e-fbc0-11e6-81fd-85466a6b98b2.png)

#### If there is not enough horizontal space the mode is set by `state_card_mode` parameter
![medium](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/23335594/e909eee2-fbc0-11e6-8429-8648b89d6d13.png) ![narrow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478779/23335595/eceaa92a-fbc0-11e6-9dff-018585f60ff0.png)

| `state_card_mode` value | description |
| --- | --- |
| break-slider-toggle | Move the slider and the toggle together to a second line. |
| single-line | Never use more than one line. Shrink the name and the slider. |
| break-slider | Move slider to second line. Leave toggle on the first line.|
| hide-slider | Hide the slider.|
| no-slider (default) | Never show the slider even if there is enough space. |

#### If the slider got moved to a new line it will be 200 px wide.
Use `stretch_slider` attribute to make it strech to all available space.

#### The slider behavior is controlled by `slider_theme` dictionary.
In that dictionary the following optional fields are available:

| field | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| min | 0 | Minimum slider value |
| max | 255 for light, 100 for cover | Maximum slider value |
| pin | False | Display numeric value when moving the slider |
| off_when_min | True | Whether to turn the light *off* when moving the slider to the minimum value if that value is not 0 |
| report_when_not_changed | True | Whether to send the light-controlling command if the slider was returned to the initial position. I.e. you moved the slider and then changed your mind |

  customize:
    light.bedroom:
      custom_ui_state_card: state-card-custom-ui
